# AW-Object-Password-Decoder
Decodes AW Object passwords.

Activeworlds sends object passwords for worlds to the client and the client stores them encoded. The client decodes the password only when it needs it and removes the plaintext password from memory once it's done. This script replicates the decoding function.
